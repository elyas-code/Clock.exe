# Clock.exe
Clock.exe is a great app for media PCs that are always on, quick warning it runs best on Windows 7 might not work on Windows 10/8.1/8, this is due to the source code being written in VB.NET 2010 which is not a problem due to most of the media PCs are recycled computers running Windows 7
